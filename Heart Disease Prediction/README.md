# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction

> *"Early detection saves lives — let's use data to make it happen."*

This project aims to predict the likelihood of **heart disease** in patients based on key medical attributes using **Machine Learning**. It walks through the entire end-to-end process — from **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Data Preprocessing** to **Model Training**, **Evaluation**, and **Deployment** using **Streamlit**.

## 📊 Project Overview

Heart disease remains one of the leading causes of death worldwide. This project demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to help in **early diagnosis** by identifying patterns and risk factors in patient data.

The workflow follows a **complete ML pipeline**:

1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
   - Handle missing values  
   - Encode categorical features  
   - Scale numerical data  
   - Split data into train and test sets  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Understand distributions and correlations  
   - Visualize relationships between features  
   - Identify important predictors of heart disease  

3. **Model Training & Evaluation**  
   Trained five fundamental classification algorithms:
   - 🧠 **Logistic Regression**  
   - 👥 **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**  
   - ⚙️ **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**  
   - 🌳 **Decision Tree Classifier**  
   - 🧩 **Naive Bayes Classifier**

   Each model was evaluated using metrics like:
   - Accuracy  
   - Precision  
   - Recall  
   - F1-Score  
   - Confusion Matrix  

4. **Model Selection**  
   The best-performing model was chosen based on the highest overall performance across metrics.

5. **Deployment**  
   The final model was deployed as a **Streamlit Web App**, providing a user-friendly interface for real-time prediction.
