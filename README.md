## 🎯 About This Repository

This repo serves as my digital notebook, portfolio, and sandbox. My goal is to create a comprehensive collection of my work, from basic concepts to complex projects.

Here, you'll find:
* **💻 Code Implementations:** Algorithms built from scratch and with popular libraries.
* **📓 Jupyter Notebooks:** Detailed experiments, data visualizations, and tutorials.
* **📊 End-to-End Projects:** Real-world problem-solving using ML.
* **📝 Notes & Summaries:** Key concepts, formulas, and resources that have helped me learn.
