# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction  
A Machine Learning project that predicts passenger survival on the RMS Titanic using supervised learning techniques.

---

## 📌 Overview  
This project analyzes the famous **Titanic dataset** to determine which passengers were more likely to survive the disaster, based on attributes such as age, gender, ticket class, family size, etc.  
It involves complete ML workflow including **EDA, data cleaning, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation**.
